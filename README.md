# House_prices_MachineLearning By using linear regression and gradient descent

Real estate is the least transparent industry in our ecosystem. 
Housing prices keep changing day in and day out and sometimes are hyped rather than being based on valuation. Predicting housing prices with real factors is the main crux of our research project. 
Here we aim to make our evaluations based on every basic parameter that is considered while determining the price. We use various regression techniques in this pathway, and our results are not sole determination of one technique rather it is the weighted mean of various techniques to give most accurate results. The results proved that this approach yields minimum error and maximum accuracy than individual algorithms applied.

Linear Regression:

Itâ€™s a supervised machine learning algorithm which learns from given x dependent variable and Y as quantifiable variable and predicts New Y from given new X.
It works in a way such that it finds the best fit line from the given data

Gradient Descent:

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).
